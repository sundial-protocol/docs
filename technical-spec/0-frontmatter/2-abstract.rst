Abstract
--------

Sundial is the first optimistic rollup protocol on Cardano.  
It offloads transaction processing from Layer 1 (L1) to Layer 2 (L2) while maintaining L1's security and decentralization properties.  
As a result, it can handle a significantly higher volume of transactions without compromising on security.

This whitepaper outlines:

- Interactions between L1 and L2
- The role of operators and watchers
- State transition mechanics
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

Sundial's architecture represents a major advancement in the scalability and security of general-purpose L2s on Cardano.

**Economic Model:**

- Operators post **bonds** to guarantee block validity
- **Bonds are slashed** when blocks are proven invalid
- **Watchers** are rewarded for submitting fraud proofs that prevent invalid block inclusion

**Key Architecture Features:**

- L1 smart contracts manage transitions and enforce security
- Operator management system
- L2 block storage
- Fraud proof validation

Overall, Sundial aims to be a scalable, secure backbone for the Cardano ecosystem.
